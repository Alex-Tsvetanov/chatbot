Slide 1
Good morning, everyone! My name is Alex Tsvetanov and I am a 9th grade student at the SHSM. Over the past couple of weeks I worked under the supervision of Zlatogor Minchev and Emil Kelevedzhiev on a project called ‘Artificial Teacher’.
Slide 2
The main aim of my project is to build a system that combines the newest techniques to make education more interesting. That will be achieved by combining the best practices in organizing trainings. As a part of my project I have developed an educational application where through a conversation with an artificial teacher the student can learn more about topics that they are interested in. 
Slide 3
So, you might ask, why is that application useful?
Well, there are two reasons -
	It can be used as a self-study resource and for implementing the most modern technologies to education. 
It also allows young people to dive in the most up to date technologies. What is more, it can provoke the interest of young people in the school subjects.
Slide 4
The architecture of the application is constructed by big API which uses NN and ES to ask and answer questions. The trainee communicates with the API through the visual interface.
Slide 5
The innovation in my project is that I am combining two modern technologies - … and … . to make learning closer to the new generation. This will make education more interactive.
Slide 6
What I have done so far is to develop a NN API and a prototype of the user interface.
Slide 7
However, I still have a lot of work to do on this project. I plan on improving the API, to finish the…, to build .., to finish … ,,,,, and to build an AR application.
Slide 9
I am extremely grateful to …. And would also like to thank…
